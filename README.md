**Image Preprocessing & Masking Workflow (Asset Management – Industry Internship Project)**

**1. Project Overview**
  - This project documents the image preprocessing and masking workflow developed during an industry internship supporting asset management inspection processes for a major utility company (TNB)
  - The objective was to prepare raw inspection images for structured dataset usage
  - This repository demonstrates the preprocessing methodology only
  - No confidential or proprietary data is included

**2. Business Context**

Asset management inspection images collected from field environments often contain:
  - Irrelevant background elements
  - Visual noise
  - Inconsistent framing
  - Non-standardised formatting

**3. Preprocessing Workflow**

Step 1 – Raw Image Collection.
Images extracted from inspection sources for asset monitoring purposes.

Step 2 – Image Masking
  - Removed irrelevant regions
  - Focused attention on asset defect areas
  - Reduced visual noise

Step 3 – Watermark Application
  - Applied standardised watermark for traceability
  - Ensured consistent placement and formatting

Step 4 – Image Standardization
  - Maintained uniform dimensions
  - Verified visual clarity
  - Ensured consistent file naming convention

Step 5 – Dataset Readiness Check
Final quality check before images were passed for the next tasks.

**4. Data Quality Controls Applied**

  - Consistent masking standards
  - Standardised watermark placement
  - Visual clarity verification

**5. Tools Used**

  - GIMP
  - Adobe Photoshop
  - Image preprocessing tools

**6. Key Learning**

  - Standardisation practices in enterprise-level projects
  - Role of data preparation in asset management analytics
