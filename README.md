**Image Preprocessing & Masking Workflow (Asset Management – Industry Internship Project)**

**1. Project Overview**
  - This project documents the image preprocessing and masking workflow developed during an industry internship supporting asset management inspection processes for a major utility company (TNB)
  - The objective was to prepare raw inspection images for structured dataset usage
  - This repository demonstrates the preprocessing methodology only
  - No confidential or proprietary data is included

**2. Business Context**

Asset management inspection images collected from field environments often contain:
  - Irrelevant background elements
  - Visual noise
  - Inconsistent framing
  - Non-standardised formatting

**3. Preprocessing Workflow**

Step 1 – Step 1 – Initial Cropping & Region Focus

**4. Data Quality Controls Applied**

  - Consistent masking standards
  - Standardised watermark placement
  - Visual clarity verification

**5. Tools Used**

  - GIMP
  - Adobe Photoshop
  - Image preprocessing tools (Panoramic Image Masking Tool & Panoramic Image Watermarking Tool)

**6. Key Learning**

  - Standardisation practices in enterprise-level projects
  - Role of data preparation in asset management analytics
