**Image Preprocessing & Masking Workflow for Computer Vision Dataset Preparation**

**1. Project Overview**

  This project demonstrates the image preprocessing workflow applied to prepare raw road images for computer vision model training.
The focus was on masking, watermarking, and standardizing images to ensure dataset consistency and training readiness.

**2. Problem Statement**

  - Raw images collected from field environments often contain:
  - Noise and irrelevant background elements
  - Inconsistent dimensions
  - Visual distractions
  - Non-standardized formatting
  - Without preprocessing, model training performance may degrade due to poor data quality.

**3. Preprocessing Workflow**

Step 1 – Raw Image Collection.
Images extracted from road inspection sources.

Step 2 – Image Masking.
Irrelevant regions masked to focus on defect areas.

Step 3 – Watermark Application.
Standard watermark added for dataset control and traceability.

Step 4 – Image Standardization.
Ensured consistent formatting and visual clarity.

Step 5 – Dataset Readiness Check.
Final review before annotation and training usage.

**4. Data Preparation Controls**

  - Consistent masking standards
  - Uniform watermark placement
  - Visual clarity verification
  - File naming standardization

**5. Tools Used**

  - GIMP
  - Adobe Photoshop
  - Image preprocessing tools

**6. Key Learning**

  - Importance of clean training data
  - Role of preprocessing in model performance
  - Visual data standardization
  - Dataset preparation best practices
